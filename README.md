# AI Agents Collection

A curated collection of specialized AI agent projects built using **Google ADK (Agent Development Kit)** and **LangGraph**. This repository serves as my experimental playground for understanding agentic workflows across different applications and domains.

## 🎯 Purpose

Each agent in this collection is designed with a **single, focused goal** to demonstrate how AI agents can be effectively deployed for specific tasks. These projects help me explore and understand:

- **Agentic workflows** in various real-world scenarios
- **Domain-specific applications** of AI agents
- **Best practices** for agent development and deployment
- **Integration patterns** between different AI frameworks

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Google ADK (Agent Development Kit)** - For building and deploying AI agents
- **LangGraph** - For creating complex, stateful agent workflows
- **Python** - Primary development language
- **Various AI/ML frameworks** - Depending on the specific agent requirements

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Google Cloud Platform account (for ADK)
- LangGraph installation

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd AI-Agents

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up Google ADK
# Follow Google ADK setup instructions

# Configure LangGraph
# Follow LangGraph setup instructions
```

## 🎯 Agent Types

This collection includes various types of specialized agents:

- **Data Processing Agents** - For ETL, data cleaning, and analysis
- **Content Generation Agents** - For writing, summarization, and creative tasks
- **Decision Support Agents** - For analysis and recommendation systems
- **Integration Agents** - For connecting different systems and APIs
- **Domain-Specific Agents** - Tailored for specific industries or use cases

## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### Agent Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility** - Each agent has one clear, focused goal
2. **Modularity** - Agents can be easily combined or extended
3. **Observability** - Built-in logging and monitoring capabilities
4. **Error Handling** - Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. **Documentation** - Clear documentation for each agent's purpose and usage

### Best Practices

- Use LangGraph for complex, stateful workflows
- Leverage Google ADK for deployment and scaling
- Implement proper testing for each agent
- Document agent capabilities and limitations
- Version control all agent configurations
